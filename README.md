The requirement of this project:
Use https://ant.design/ to find your table UI and implement it using Redux, Redux-Thunk. The API is found here: https://swapi.dev/ and you should display all the /people in the database on a table. If some fields are missing for some people, please handle that in a nice way.

You MUST write your code on a github repo that you later can send in to show all your commits.
